# Chromosome shattering at the origin of Clitellata

## 1. Description
This repository contains the scripts and files needed to reproduce the analysis in: *A punctuated burst of massive genomic rearrangements by chromosome shattering  and the origin of non-marine annelids*.

## 2. Directories in this repository
- **Composite_gene_analyses:** This directory contains the scripts needed to idenfity composite genes.
- **Gene_repertoire_evolutionary_dynamics:** This directory contains the scripts and files needed to perform the gene repertoire evolutionary analysis for a set of annelids and their outgroups.
- **Hox_genes_inference:** This directory contains the files and scripts needed to identify and classify Hox genes in annelids.
- **Inference_of_ancestral_linkage_groups:** This directory contains the scripts needed to obtain the Oxford dotplots and the ribbon diagrams from the output of odp.
- **Transcriptomes:** This directory contains the newly generated transcriptome for *Hirudo medicinalis*.
- **Transposable_element_satellite_DNA_and_centromere_identification_and_analysis:** This directory contains the scripts needed to identify the centromeres using the transposable element coverage and to plot them along with the tandem repeats coverage along the genome.
- **Whole_genome_alignment_and_whole_genome_duplication_analysis:** This directory contains the output of halStats for the whole genome alignment using progressiveCactus.
